This paper examines and analyzes the factors influencing employment and unemployment rates across various demographic groups, using the 2021 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) dataset. The study focuses on a wide array of determinants including age, gender, race, education levels, parental education, job preferences, and citizenship status. To predict employment outcomes, five distinct statistical and machine learning models are utilized: a Multivariate Logit Model, a Deep Learning Logit Model, a Probit Model, a Random Forest Model, and a K-nearest Neighbors (K-n) Model. We create a tailored subset of variables for each model to enhance prediction accuracy and address specific statistical issues such as multicollinearity and overfitting. The analysis details the results of these models, discusses the occurrence and implications of identified errors, and aims at explaining the reasons behind them. The objective of this study is to identify key predictive variables and compare the accuracy of these models in interpreting labor market dynamics.
